A modular Python framework for building synthetic data generation pipelines using composable blocks and flows. Transform datasets through **building-block composition** - mix and match LLM-powered and traditional processing blocks to create sophisticated data generation workflows.

## üß± Core Philosophy

**Blocks** are composable units that transform datasets - think of them as data processing Lego pieces. Each block performs a specific task: LLM chat, text parsing, evaluation, or transformation.

**Flows** orchestrate multiple blocks into complete pipelines defined in YAML. Chain blocks together to create complex data generation workflows with validation and parameter management.

```
# Simple concept: Blocks transform data, Flows chain blocks together

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **üîß Modular Composability** - Mix and match blocks like Lego pieces. Build simple transformations or complex multi-stage pipelines with YAML-configured flows.

- **‚ö° Async Performance** - High-throughput LLM processing with built-in error handling and concurrent execution.

- **üõ°Ô∏è Built-in Validation** - Pydantic-based type safety ensures your configurations and data are correct before execution.

- **üîç Auto-Discovery** - Automatic block and flow registration. No manual imports or complex setup required.

- **üìä Rich Monitoring** - Detailed logging with progress bars and execution summaries for visibility into your pipelines.

- **üß© Easily Extensible** - Create custom blocks with simple inheritance. Rich logging and monitoring built-in.
